# Configuration

Logbuch reads its configuration from environment variables. Blank values count
as unset. Every process validates what it needs at startup and stops with a
list of missing or invalid variables.

Three processes run from one image (see [deployment](deployment.md)):
`migrate`, `web`, and `worker`. The tables below say which process needs a
variable.

## Required

| Variable | Process | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | all | `postgres://user:password@host:5432/logbuch` |
| `LOGBUCH_BASE_URL` | web, worker | The public URL, e.g. `https://logbuch.example.org`. Used for login redirects and links in messages |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | web | At least 32 characters: `openssl rand -base64 32`. Signs session cookies |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | web | Issuer URL of the OpenID Connect provider, e.g. `https://auth.example.org/realms/acme` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | web | Client ID registered for Logbuch |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | web | Its client secret |

## Login

| Variable | Default | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `OIDC_SCOPES` | `openid profile email` | Scopes requested at login, separated by spaces |
| `OIDC_TRUST_EMAIL` | `false` | `true` treats every email address from the provider as verified. Only for providers that do not send `email_verified` (e.g. Microsoft Entra ID) and whose users cannot choose their own address |

See [identity and access](identity-and-access.md) for the redirect URI and
provider-specific notes.

## Directory: who has access

| Variable | Default | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `DIRECTORY` | `manual` | `manual`: admins invite people in Logbuch. `keycloak`: people and teams come from Keycloak groups |

With `DIRECTORY=manual`:

| Variable | Default | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` | required | Email addresses, separated by commas. While Logbuch has no admin, the first login with one of them (verified by the provider) becomes an admin. Without it, nobody could ever get in; afterwards it has no effect |

With `DIRECTORY=keycloak` (needed by web and worker). All three groups are
required: every entry belongs to a team, and only admins manage tags and
unblock stuck proposals. Write group paths with a leading slash and without a
trailing one.

| Variable | Default | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_GROUP` | required | Group path, e.g. `/logbuch`. Its members, and members of its subgroups, have access |
| `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_GROUP` | required | Group path, e.g. `/logbuch-admins`. Its members are admins (and have access) |
| `KEYCLOAK_TEAMS_GROUP` | required | Group path, e.g. `/teams`. Each direct subgroup is a team; it needs at least one |
| `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` | `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | Client with a service account that may read users and groups |
| `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` | `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | Its secret |

`OIDC_ISSUER` must be the realm URL (`…/realms/<realm>`); the Admin API URL is
derived from it.

## Notifications (worker)

Slack and email are each optional. Events prefer Slack and reminders prefer
email; when one is off, or cannot reach a person (no Slack account, no email
address), the message goes out on the other. Without either, Logbuch only
shows tasks in the app.

| Variable | Default | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | none | Bot token (`xoxb-…`) of a Slack app with the scopes `chat:write`, `users:read`, and `users:read.email` |
| `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` | none | Channel ID (`C…`) for one post per new entry. Invite the app to the channel |
| `SMTP_URL` | none | `smtp://user:password@host:587` (STARTTLS) or `smtps://user:password@host:465`. Percent-encode special characters in the password |
| `MAILERSEND_API_TOKEN` | none | MailerSend API token with email sending access. Use either SMTP or MailerSend |
| `MAIL_FROM` | none | Sender address; required with SMTP or MailerSend |
| `MAIL_FROM_NAME` | `Logbuch` | Sender name |
| `NOTIFICATION_TRANSPORT` | `live` in production, otherwise `console` | `console` only logs messages instead of sending them |

## Webhook (worker)

| Variable | Default | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | none | HTTPS endpoint that receives published entries. Off without it |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | none | At least 16 characters; required with `WEBHOOK_URL`. Signs every request |

See [webhook](webhooks.md).

## Time zone

Logbuch uses the server's time zone, set with the standard `TZ` variable
(e.g. `TZ=Europe/Vienna`; the Docker image defaults to UTC). It decides when a
deadline day ends (23:59), when reminders go out (09:00 on working days,
Monday to Friday), and the months in the statistics. Everyone can choose their
own time zone and date format for display under **Settings**; the default
date format is `DD.MM.YYYY`.

## Operations

| Variable | Default | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `WORKER_HEARTBEAT_FILE` | `/tmp/logbuch-worker-heartbeat` | File the worker touches for its health check |
| `MIGRATIONS_DIR` | `drizzle` | Folder with the SQL migrations |
