# Identity and access

Logbuch has no passwords of its own. People sign in with an OpenID Connect
(OIDC) provider, and a **directory** decides who has access, who is an admin,
and which team each person belongs to.

- **Manual directory** (`DIRECTORY=manual`, the default): admins invite people
  by email and manage teams in Logbuch. Works with any OIDC provider.
- **Keycloak directory** (`DIRECTORY=keycloak`): people, admins, and teams
  come from Keycloak groups and are synced every 15 minutes.

Whichever directory you use, Logbuch never deletes people. Someone who leaves
loses access, and their name stays on past entries.

## OpenID Connect login

Register Logbuch as a confidential client (authorization code flow with PKCE)
at your provider:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Redirect URI | `<LOGBUCH_BASE_URL>/api/auth/callback/oidc` |
| Post-logout redirect URI | `<LOGBUCH_BASE_URL>/` |
| Scopes | `openid profile email` |
| Client authentication | Client secret |

Then set `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`. Logbuch
reads the provider's endpoints from
`<OIDC_ISSUER>/.well-known/openid-configuration`. If the provider publishes an
`end_session_endpoint`, signing out of Logbuch also signs out of the provider.

Typical issuer URLs:

| Provider | `OIDC_ISSUER` |
|---|---|
| Keycloak | `https://<host>/realms/<realm>` |
| Microsoft Entra ID | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0` |
| Google | `https://accounts.google.com` |
| Okta | `https://<org>.okta.com` |
| Authentik | `https://<host>/application/o/<slug>/` |

The provider must send the `email` claim, and `email_verified` must be true
for invitations and `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` to match. A login is linked to a
person by the OIDC subject (`sub`) after that.

Some providers never send `email_verified=true`: Microsoft Entra ID does not
send the claim, and Authentik depends on its scope mapping. If your users
cannot choose their own email address at the provider (it is managed by your
organization), set `OIDC_TRUST_EMAIL=true`. Do not set it for providers where
people sign up themselves or edit their address, since an invitation would
then go to whoever enters that address first.

## Manual directory

1. Set `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` (required) to your own email address and sign
   in. While Logbuch has no admin, the first login whose verified email is in
   that list becomes an admin.
2. Under **Admin → Teams**, create the teams that own entries. Until there is
   one, nobody can create entries, and the new-entry page says so.
3. Under **Admin → People**, invite people with their email address, a name,
   and optionally a team. An invited person gets access at their first login
   with the same verified email address; the name from the provider then
   replaces the one in the invitation.
4. On the same page, admins change names and teams, make people admins, and
   take access away. Taking access away ends the person's sessions at once.
   Nobody can take away their own access, and the last admin always stays.

Anyone else who signs in at the provider sees "No access".

## Keycloak directory

Logbuch reads the members of three Keycloak groups through the Keycloak Admin
API. All three are required:

- Members of `KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_GROUP`, and of its subgroups, have access.
  Disabled users do not.
- Members of `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_GROUP` (and its subgroups) are admins, and have
  access too.
- Each direct subgroup of `KEYCLOAK_TEAMS_GROUP` is a team (the group itself
  is not). A person in several teams belongs to the first one by name.
  Members of a team's subgroups belong to that team. Someone in no team
  chooses one for each entry. Being in a team does not grant access; set
  `KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_GROUP` to the teams group if every team member should
  have it.
- Teams are matched by their Keycloak group ID: renaming a group renames the
  team, and old entries keep it. A team group that is removed becomes an
  inactive team, kept on old entries but not offered for new ones.

For example:

```text
/logbuch            ← KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_GROUP=/logbuch
/logbuch-admins     ← KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_GROUP=/logbuch-admins
/teams              ← KEYCLOAK_TEAMS_GROUP=/teams
  /Engineering
  /Operations
```

The worker syncs every 15 minutes and once at startup. An admin can start a
sync on the admin page. People missing from the groups lose access, and their
sessions end. A failed sync, or one that would find nobody, keeps the last
state and shows the error on the admin page; so does a sync that finds no
team. Someone who signs in before the next sync triggers a sync of their own
(at most once a minute).

### Keycloak setup

1. Create a client, e.g. `logbuch`:
   - Client authentication: on
   - Authentication flow: standard flow, with PKCE method S256
   - Service accounts: on (for the sync)
   - Valid redirect URIs: `<LOGBUCH_BASE_URL>/api/auth/callback/oidc`
   - Valid post-logout redirect URIs: `<LOGBUCH_BASE_URL>/`
   - Web origins: `<LOGBUCH_BASE_URL>`
2. Under the client's **Service account roles**, assign the role
   `view-users` of the client `realm-management`. It lets the sync read users
   and group members, nothing else.
3. Create the groups and add people to them.
4. Set:

   ```sh
   OIDC_ISSUER=https://auth.example.org/realms/acme
   OIDC_CLIENT_ID=logbuch
   OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=…
   DIRECTORY=keycloak
   KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_GROUP=/logbuch
   KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_GROUP=/logbuch-admins
   KEYCLOAK_TEAMS_GROUP=/teams
   ```

To keep login and sync apart, create a second client with only service
accounts on, give it the `view-users` role, and set `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` and
`KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` to it.

[`dev/keycloak/logbuch-realm.json`](../dev/keycloak/logbuch-realm.json) is a
complete example realm, used by `docker compose up` and the end-to-end tests.

## Switching directories

People invited in the manual directory lose access at the first Keycloak
sync unless they are members of the access group: the sync creates its own
people, keyed by their Keycloak user ID. Their earlier entries stay under
their old person record.
