# Contributing

Thank you for helping with Logbuch. Bug reports, ideas, and pull requests are
welcome. For larger changes, please open an issue first, so we can agree on
the approach before you write the code.

## Development setup

Requirements: Node.js 26, npm, and Docker.

```sh
docker compose up -d       # PostgreSQL 18 (port 55432) and Keycloak (port 8090)
cp .env.example .env.local
npm ci
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev                # http://localhost:3000
npm run worker             # in a second terminal
```

Test users in the development Keycloak (password `logbuch-dev`): `erika`
(has access), `adam` (admin), and `olga` (no access). The Keycloak admin
console is at http://localhost:8090 (`admin` / `admin`).

## Checks

```sh
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test                   # unit tests
npm run test:integration   # against the PostgreSQL from docker compose
npm run build
```

End-to-end tests run against production builds; `AGENTS.md` lists the steps.
CI runs all of these on every pull request.

## Conventions

`AGENTS.md` describes the architecture and the rules the code follows: where
writes happen, how access is checked, how notifications and the webhook are
recorded, and why nothing is deleted. In short:

- Keep pages and Server Actions thin; put logic in `src/lib/<module>/`, with
  tests next to it.
- Change the database schema in `src/lib/db/schema.ts` and generate the
  migration with `npm run db:generate`.
- Add or change environment variables in `src/lib/config.ts` and document
  them in `docs/configuration.md`.
- UI text is English (US), short and plain.

## Pull requests

- One topic per pull request, with tests for new behavior.
- Describe what changes for users and admins, and how you tested it.
- Never commit secrets, real personal data, or data from a real organization,
  also not in tests and fixtures. Use `example.org` addresses.

## Security

Please report vulnerabilities privately; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
