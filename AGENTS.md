# AGENTS.md

Logbuch is a self-hosted log of decisions, updates, and learnings with a
consent-based decision process. User documentation is in `docs/`;
contributor setup is in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, Server Actions, `src/proxy.ts`), Node.js 26, npm,
strict TypeScript, PostgreSQL 18 with Drizzle ORM (`pg` driver), Better Auth
with one OpenID Connect provider (PKCE), pg-boss worker, zod 4, Tailwind 4
with shadcn/ui (Radix), pino, Vitest, Playwright.

## Layout

- `src/app/`: routes. Pages, Server Actions, and route handlers stay thin:
  check access, validate input with zod, call a module.
- `src/components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components (new-york-v4), copied into the
  repository; there is no `shadcn` package. Use them for every control, list,
  and panel. The app shell (sidebar, header, breadcrumb) follows
  `src/lib/navigation.ts`.
- `src/lib/<module>/`: `auth`, `directory` (manual and Keycloak directory),
  `db`, `entries`, `process`, `calendar`, `audit`, `health`, `jobs`,
  `security`, `notifications`, `measures`, `webhooks`, `csv-import`.
- `src/workers/`: the pg-boss worker. `src/scripts/`: migrate, directory
  sync, and the CSV import. Both are bundled with esbuild into `dist/`.
- `drizzle/`: SQL migrations. `e2e/`: Playwright. `tests/`: test helpers and
  fixtures. Unit tests sit next to the code (`*.test.ts`), integration tests
  too (`*.int.test.ts`).

## Rules

- Every page, Server Action, and route handler calls `requireUser()` or
  `requireAdmin()` from `src/lib/auth/session.ts`. Layouts do not re-render
  on navigation, so a check in a layout is not enough.
- Never delete Logbuch data. The only exceptions are unsubmitted drafts and
  Better Auth sessions. Triggers in `drizzle/0001_no_deletion.sql` enforce it,
  and the audit log is append-only. People who leave lose access; teams and
  tags are deactivated.
- Entry writes go through `src/lib/entries/commands.ts`: one transaction per
  write, with its audit event. Server Actions validate with the zod schemas
  in `src/lib/entries/schemas.ts`, which the forms share, and call
  `consumeRateLimit` first. Content forms require the personal data
  confirmation; the server checks it again.
- Proposal status changes only through `src/lib/process/commands.ts`. The
  rules of the decision process (`docs/decision-process.md`) live as pure
  functions in `src/lib/process/rules.ts` (table-tested); commands lock the
  proposal, check the rules, write, and record the audit event in one
  transaction. The UI asks the same rules what to show.
- Notifications are rows in `notification_delivery`, written in the
  command's transaction through `src/lib/notifications/notify.ts`. Who gets
  which message is planned by pure functions in `src/lib/notifications/plan.ts`
  (tested); each delivery key names the event, the occurrence, and the
  recipient, so nothing is recorded twice. Only the worker sends
  (`dispatch.ts`): Slack for events and email for reminders, each falling back
  to the other channel when it is off or cannot reach the person. Never put the proposal text in a
  message. Messages carry dates as tokens (`dateToken`), written in each
  recipient's date format when sent.
- A command that publishes, edits, decides, supersedes, changes the impact
  of, or adds an addendum to an entry calls `requestWebhook`
  (`src/lib/webhooks/sync.ts`) in its transaction; the worker sends. The
  payload mapping in `payload.ts` is a pure function.
- Who has access comes from the directory (`DIRECTORY`): the manual directory
  (`src/lib/directory/manage.ts`, invitations linked at the first login in
  `src/lib/auth/access.ts`) or the Keycloak sync (`keycloak-adapter.ts`,
  `sync.ts`). Link logins by the OIDC `sub`; match an email only once, and
  only when the provider verified it (or `OIDC_TRUST_EMAIL` is set). Settings
  without which the app cannot be used (the first admins, the Keycloak
  groups) are required in `config.ts`, so a deployment fails at startup
  instead of later.
- Deadlines, working days (Monday to Friday), reminders, and statistics use
  the server's time zone (`serverDate`, `serverDateTime` in `src/lib/format.ts`).
  Everything shown to a person uses their preferences: `getFormatter()` in
  server components, `createDateFormatter()` elsewhere.
- Form Server Actions use `handleFormAction` from `src/lib/form-actions.ts`
  (access, validation, rate limit, write, revalidate, redirect). Forms submit
  through `useFormAction`, which keeps input after a rejected submit.
- After a Server Action redirect, call `revalidatePath` for the target, or a
  redirect to the same page shows stale data.
- Change the schema in `src/lib/db/schema.ts`, then run `npm run db:generate`
  and commit the migration. CI fails if they differ.
- Read application settings only through `src/lib/config.ts`, and
  operational settings (`LOG_LEVEL`, `LOGBUCH_PROCESS`,
  `WORKER_HEARTBEAT_FILE`, `MIGRATIONS_DIR`) through `envValue()` in
  `src/lib/env.ts`. Both treat blank values as unset. Framework variables
  (`NODE_ENV`, `NEXT_RUNTIME`, `TZ`) are read directly. Document every new
  variable in `docs/configuration.md`.
- UI text is English (US).

## Commands

```sh
docker compose up -d            # PostgreSQL 18 (port 55432) and Keycloak (port 8090)
cp .env.example .env.local
npm ci
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000, users erika / adam / olga, password logbuch-dev
npm run worker                  # pg-boss worker in a second terminal

npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test                        # unit tests
npm run test:integration        # needs the PostgreSQL from docker compose
npm run build                   # Next.js standalone build and dist/ bundles
```

End-to-end tests run against production builds, Keycloak, and PostgreSQL:
one instance with the Keycloak directory (port 3000) and one with the manual
directory and a fresh database (port 3001). CI's `e2e` job shows the exact
steps; locally:

```sh
npm run build && cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/ && cp -r public .next/standalone/
set -a; source .env.example; set +a
export BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" NODE_ENV=production TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
node dist/migrate.mjs
node .next/standalone/server.js &
node dist/worker.mjs &
docker compose exec postgres psql -U logbuch -c "drop database if exists logbuch_manual with (force)" -c "create database logbuch_manual"
DATABASE_URL=postgres://logbuch:logbuch@localhost:55432/logbuch_manual DIRECTORY=manual \
  INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS=adam@example.test LOGBUCH_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 PORT=3001 \
  sh -c 'node dist/migrate.mjs && node .next/standalone/server.js' &
DATABASE_URL=postgres://logbuch:logbuch@localhost:55432/logbuch npm run test:e2e
```

The proposal tests move deadlines into the past in the database instead of
waiting for working days, and one test changes Keycloak group memberships
through the Admin API.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, typecheck, unit tests, a
migration check, build, `npm audit`, integration tests, end-to-end tests,
and a Docker build. Use only GitHub-owned actions, pinned by commit SHA.

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
